# Model Deployment Testing Lab

In this lab, we will assess the performance of various deployments, including:

1. **Deployment using FastAPI**

   - Deployed an NLP model (transformer) using FastAPI.
   - Demonstrated API functionality with screenshots from FastAPI and Postman.

2. **Containerizing API using Docker**

   - Containerized the API using Docker for easier deployment and scalability.

3. **Serving a Transformer Model using TFX**

   - Deployed a transformer-type model using TensorFlow Extended (TFX).

4. **Load Testing using Locust**

   ![Locust Screenshot](https://github.com/SalmaTADLAOUI/Model_Deployement_Testing/assets/76519142/57675693-de26-41af-aac5-45706db5e5f0)

   - Performed load testing using Locust to evaluate system performance under various loads.

## Setup and Execution

1. **FastAPI Deployment**

   - Follow the instructions in the `fastapi-deployment` directory for deploying the model using FastAPI.

2. **Docker Containerization**

   - Navigate to the `docker-containerization` directory for details on containerizing the API using Docker.

3. **TFX Deployment**

   - Refer to the `tfx-deployment` directory for deploying the transformer model using TensorFlow Extended.

4. **Locust Load Testing**

   - Explore the `locust-load-testing` directory for executing load tests using Locust.

## Results

- Analyze the results obtained from each deployment to make informed decisions on performance and scalability.
